# Pause Project Scratchpad
**Current Role:** Planner
**MVP Status:** Not Started
**GitHub Repo:** (To be created)
**Last Push:** (None yet)

## Background and Motivation
The Pause app is a minimalist breath-holding training app designed for simplicity. The user journey centers around a single, repeatable exercise: guided breathing preparation followed by a timed breath-hold. The app helps users track and improve their breath-hold duration over time in a calm, frictionless environment.

## Research Findings
### Current Issues Identified
- Missing `ContentView.swift` file causing compilation failure
- Project configured for macOS instead of iOS (should be mobile app)
- No implementation of core functionality from concept document
- Only basic app structure exists

### User Pain Points
1. App cannot compile or run due to missing essential files
2. Platform mismatch prevents proper mobile development and testing
3. No working prototype to validate the breathing exercise concept

### MVP Definition
**Core Features (Build First):**
- [x] Fix compilation issues and missing files
- [ ] Create basic ContentView with clean, minimal UI
- [ ] Implement "Begin Your Pause" main interaction
- [ ] Build guided breathing timer (4s inhale, 6s exhale, 3 cycles)
- [ ] Create breath-hold timer with visual feedback (expanding circle)
- [ ] Display session results (hold time + encouragement message)
- [ ] Basic app navigation and state management

**Enhancements (Build Later):**
- [ ] Progressive unlocks system (streak-based)
- [ ] Multiple breathing exercise types
- [ ] Visual history tracking ("constellation" dots)
- [ ] Educational content ("The Vault")
- [ ] Advanced customization options
- [ ] Premium features and monetization

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Platform Configuration**: Need to reconfigure project for iOS instead of macOS
2. **SwiftUI Architecture**: Design clean MVVM structure for timer-based interactions
3. **User Experience**: Create calming, distraction-free interface that enhances focus
4. **Timer Precision**: Ensure accurate timing for breathing guidance and hold measurement
5. **State Management**: Handle app lifecycle during breathing exercises

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP - Critical Priority)
1. **Fix Project Structure** 
   - Create missing ContentView.swift file
   - Configure project for iOS platform
   - Verify successful compilation and basic app launch
   - Success: App builds and runs on iOS simulator

2. **Core UI Implementation**
   - Design minimal main screen with pulsating circle
   - Add "Begin Your Pause" button with proper styling
   - Implement basic navigation between states
   - Success: Clean, functional UI that matches concept aesthetics

3. **Guided Breathing Timer**
   - Build breathing preparation sequence (4s in, 6s out, 3 cycles)
   - Add visual breathing guidance and audio cues
   - Implement smooth transitions between breathing phases
   - Success: Users can complete full breathing preparation sequence

4. **Breath-Hold Timer & Visual Feedback**
   - Create expanding circle animation during breath-hold
   - Implement accurate timer counting from 00:00
   - Add "Release" button to end hold
   - Success: Visual feedback enhances hold experience, accurate timing

5. **Session Completion**
   - Display hold time results clearly
   - Show encouraging completion message
   - Return to main screen for next session
   - Success: Users get immediate feedback and motivation to continue

### Phase 2: Enhancements (Build After MVP)
6. **Basic Progress Tracking**
   - Store session history locally
   - Display current streak and personal best
   - Simple statistics screen
   - Success: Users can track improvement over time

## Project Status Board
### MVP Tasks (Priority: CRITICAL)
- [ ] Task 1: Fix compilation issues (Success: App builds and runs)
- [ ] Task 2: Core UI Implementation (Success: Clean interface with main button)
- [ ] Task 3: Guided breathing timer (Success: 4s/6s breathing cycle works)
- [ ] Task 4: Breath-hold timer (Success: Accurate timing with visual feedback)
- [ ] Task 5: Session completion (Success: Clear results display)

### Enhancement Tasks (Priority: LATER)
- [ ] Enhancement 1: Progress tracking (Success: Streak and PB display)
- [ ] Enhancement 2: Multiple exercise types
- [ ] Enhancement 3: Visual history constellation
- [ ] Enhancement 4: Educational content vault

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
