# Pause - Breath-Holding Training App

A minimalist iOS app designed for breath-holding training and meditation. Focus on a single, guided breathing exercise that helps users track and improve their breath-hold duration over time.

## Overview

Pause centers around a simple yet powerful concept: a 2-minute guided breathing exercise followed by a timed breath-hold. The app provides:

- **Guided Breathing Preparation**: 4-second inhale, 6-second exhale for 3 cycles
- **Visual Breath-Hold Timer**: Expanding circle with precise timing
- **Immediate Feedback**: Session results with encouraging messages
- **Progress Tracking**: Personal bests and streak monitoring

## Core Philosophy

The app prioritizes simplicity and immediate value over complex features. Users can open the app, complete a meaningful breathing exercise, and close it within minutes - building a sustainable daily practice.
